This is Luke Constable's portfolio site, made by me:)
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I was sick of paying for vimeo, so I built and designed a self hosted streaming video player and interface.
Take a look at NativevideoPlayer.tsx
I have also build a carousel component with the help of Embla.

Another component i'm proud of is a utility function, PortalPorter.tsx
it's a small function but it allows a video reference, or any other reference to be passed around the dom, by implementing a portal.

/////anyway, enjoy!
